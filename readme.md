# as-lunatic

Instructions for use:

First, install `assemblyscript`, and `as-lunatic`.

```
npm install --save-dev assemblyscript as-lunatic
```

Then, install [lunatic](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic).

Next, modify your asconfig to extend as-lunatic,

```json
{
  "extends": "as-lunatic/asconfig.json"
}
```

Import a lunatic library.

```ts
// assembly/index.ts
import * as lunatic from "as-lunatic";
```

Finally, export a `_start()` function so that the main thread knows what function to execute when lunatic starts up.

> Note: any code that does not reside in the _start() method will execute every time a new `thread.Process` is created.

# Process

To create another process and make work happen in parallel, use a `thread.Process` object.

A simple process might look like this:

```ts
  // Test simple process
  let simpleValueProcess = Process.spawn(42, (val: i32) => {
    assert(val == 42);
  });
  // make sure the process is finished
  assert(simpleValueProcess.join());
```

Lunatic will spin up another WebAssembly instance of your wasm module and execute your callback on another thread. Under the hood, the value passed to `Process.spawn()` will be serialized using `ASON`, and everything will happen seamlessly. If more data needs to be passed between `Process`es, a `Channel` can be used to send different kinds of messages.

# Channel

To create a `Channel`, simply call `Channel.create<T>()` where `T` is an `ASON` serializable message.

```ts
import { Channel } from "as-lunatic";

export function _start(): void {
  // create a channel
  let workChannel = Channel.create<StaticArray<u8>>(0);

  // send some work
  workChannel.send([1, 2, 3, 4]);
  workChannel.send([5, 6, 7, 8]);
  workChannel.send([9, 10, 11, 12]);

  // Channels are serializable in ASON
  Thread.start(
    workChannel,
    (workChannel: Channel<StaticArray<u8>>) => {
      workChannel.receive(); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
      workChannel.receive(); // [5, 6, 7, 8]
      workChannel.receive(); // [9, 10, 11, 12]
    },
  );
}
```

# TCP

To open a TCP server, use the net module.

```ts
import { TCPServer, TCPStream } from "as-lunatic";

// bind the server to an ip address and a port
let server = TCPServer.bind([127, 0, 0, 1], TCP_PORT);


function processSocket(socket: TCPStream): void {
  // do something with the accepted tcp socket here
}

let stream: TCPStream;

// blocks until a socket is accepted
while (stream = server.accept()) {
  // pass the socket off to another process
  Thread.start<TCPStream>(stream, processThisStream);
  stream.drop(); // when passing a stream off to another process, always drop it
}
```

To open a TCP connection, use a `TCPSocket`.

```ts
import { TCPStream } from "net";

let stream = TCPStream.connect([192, 168, 1, 1], PORT);
let buffer: StaticArray<u8>;

// socket.read() blocks until bytes are read
while (buffer = stream.read()) {
  // echo the result back to the socket until it's closed
  stream.writeBuffer(buffer);
}
```

It's also possible to resolve an IP address from a domain.

```ts
import { resolve } from "as-lunatic";
// blocks thread execution
let ip: StaticArray<u8> = resolve("mydomain.com");
```
